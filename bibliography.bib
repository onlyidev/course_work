  abstract = {To reduce the risks of malicious software, malware detection methods using machine learning have received tremendous attention in recent years. Most of the conventional methods are based on supervised learning, which relies on static features with definite labels. However, recent studies have shown the models based on supervised learning are vulnerable to deliberate attacks. This work tends to expose and demonstrate the weakness in these models. A DQEAF framework using reinforcement learning to evade anti-malware engines is presented. DQEAF trains an AI agent through a neural network by constantly interacting with malware samples. Actions are a set of reasonable modifications, which do not damage samples’ structure and functions. The agent selects the optimal sequence of actions to modify the malware samples, thus they can bypass the detection engines. The training process depends on the characteristics of the raw binary stream features of samples. The experiments show that the proposed method has a success rate of 75\%. The efficacy of the proposed DQEAF has also been evaluated by other families of malicious software, which shows good robustness.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has been used to detect new malware in recent years, while malware authors have strong motivation to attack such algorithms.Malware authors usually have no access to the detailed structures and parameters of the machine learning models used by malware detection systems, and therefore they can only perform black-box attacks. This paper proposes a generative adversarial network (GAN) based algorithm named MalGAN to generate adversarial malware examples, which are able to bypass black-box machine learning based detection models. MalGAN uses a substitute detector to fit the black-box malware detection system. A generative network is trained to minimize the generated adversarial examples’ malicious probabilities predicted by the substitute detector. The superiority of MalGAN over traditional gradient based adversarial example generation algorithms is that MalGAN is able to decrease the detection rate to nearly zero and make the retraining based defensive method against adversarial examples hard to work.},

  abstract = {In recent years, researches on malware detection using machine learning have been attracting wide attention. At the same time, how to avoid these detections is also regarded as an emerging topic. In this paper, we focus on the avoidance of malware detection based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Previous GAN-based researches use the same feature quantities for learning malware detection. Moreover, existing learning algorithms use multiple malware, which affects the performance of avoidance and is not realistic on attackers. To settle this issue, we apply differentiated learning methods with the different feature quantities and only one malware. Experimental results show that our method can achieve better performance than existing ones.},

  abstract = {For efficient malware removal, determination of malware threat levels, and damage estimation, malware family classification plays a critical role. In this paper, we extract features from malware executable files and represent them as images using various approaches. We then focus on generative adversarial networks (GAN) for multiclass classification and compare our GAN results to other popular machine learning techniques, including support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). We find that the AC-GAN discriminator is generally competitive with other machine learning techniques. We also evaluate the utility of the GAN generative model for adversarial attacks on image-based malware detection. While AC-GAN generated images are visually impressive, we find that they are easily distinguished from real malware images using any of several learning techniques. This result indicates that our GAN generated images are of surprisingly little value in adversarial attacks.},

  abstract = {Deep learning is a thriving field currently stuffed with many practical applications and active research topics. It allows computers to learn from experience and to understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts, with each being defined through its relations to simpler concepts. Relying on the strong capabilities of deep learning, we propose a convolutional generative adversarial network-based (Conv-GAN) framework titled MalFox, targeting adversarial malware example generation against third-party black-box malware detectors. Motivated by the rival game between malware authors and malware detectors, MalFox adopts a confrontational approach to produce perturbation paths, with each formed by up to three methods (namely Obfusmal, Stealmal, and Hollowmal) to generate adversarial malware examples. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MalFox, we collect a large dataset consisting of both malware and benignware programs, and investigate the performance of MalFox in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and evasive rate of the generated adversarial malware examples. Our evaluation indicates that the accuracy can be as high as 99.0\% which significantly outperforms the other 12 well-known learning models. Furthermore, the detection rate is dramatically decreased by 56.8\% on average, and the average evasive rate is noticeably improved by up to 56.2\%.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning offer attractive tools for sophisticated adversaries. An attacker could transform malware into its adversarial version but retain its malicious functionality by employing a dedicated perturbation method. These adversarial malware examples have demonstrated the effectiveness to bypass antivirus engines. However, recent works only leverage a single perturbation method to generate adversarial examples, which cannot defeat advanced detectors. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework called MalInfo, which could generate powerful adversarial malware examples to evade the third-party detectors via an adaptive selection of a perturbation path for each malware in our collected dataset with 1000 diverse malware. To cope with limited computation, MalInfo applies either dynamic programming or temporal difference learning to choose the optimal perturbation path where each path is formed by the combination of Obfusmal, Stealmal, and Hollowmal. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and extensive evaluation of our framework. Both the detection rate and evasive rate have substantially been improved compared with the state-of-art research MalFox Zhong et~al. (2021). To be specific, The average detection rates for dynamic programming and temporal difference learning are 23.2\% (21.9\% lower than MalFox) and 27.5\% (7.4\% lower than MalFox), respectively, and the average evasive rates are 65.8\% (17.1\% higher than MalFox) and 59.4\% (5.7\% higher than MalFox), respectively.},
